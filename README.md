# Novomatic Internship 2024 Tasks

- [Task 1: Data Compression](t1-data-compression)
- [Task 2: Ticket Machine](t2-ticket-machine)
- [Task 3: Collision Detection](t3-collision-detection)

All tasks have been implemented using modern C++20 (such features as concepts, `std::ranges`, `std::span`,
`std::format`, etc. were used).

## Compiler

All solutions were tested on Linux (Fedora 39) using the `clang 17.0.6` compiler.

## Dependencies

For most tasks, all necessary dependencies will be automatically downloaded
(except for Task 3, where manual installation of some dependencies is required for
compiling the visualizer).

## Testing

The **GTest 1.14.0** framework was used for testing (it will be downloaded automatically in case of all tasks).
